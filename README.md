# SJSU Eligibility Index Calculator
- This is my DIY project that calculates your eligibility to undergraduate programs at San Jose State University! This is a showcase of my abilities to implement algorithms and abstractions with the help of HTML, CSS, and JS. Plug away to find where you stand!

- This is an eligibility index calculator you can use to determine your chances of getting into your chosen program of study here at SJSU. The general idea is that if you fall above the number on the list below the calculator, you will most likely be accepted - but being above the EI does not mean you will be accepted. It just means that you fall within the pool of students that will be considered. If you are looking to apply to an engineering major, you will be focusing on the COE EI number that results from the calculation.
