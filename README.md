# AP Computer Science Principles Create Task

## Performance Task: Create â€“ Applications from Ideas
- This performance task focuses on students developing computer programs and describing significant aspects of the program that allow it to run correctly.
- Students have the flexibility to write programs that reflects their interests (e.g., their desire to solve a problem; program a game; or produce digital art appealing to a specific audience, etc.) 
- This allows students to engage in the study of computer science from a creative perspective. 
- Students will provide evidence of their knowledge of important programming concepts such as developing algorithms and using abstractions. - Students are required to submit an individual program but are able to collaborate on the development of their program.
